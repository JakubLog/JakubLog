Hello there! 🙋‍♂️
Welcome to my profile. 🤝
I'm teen from Poland with passion of IT and Programming. 🇵🇱
On my profile you can find respositories with my projects.

Currently I'm interested in Webdev, definitely in JavaScript and TypeScript.
I'm using VSCode and my primary framework is React.js and Next.js. 👀

My personal page: https://fedoszczak.ovh/ ✨

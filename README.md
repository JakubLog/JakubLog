Hello there!
Welcome to my profile.
I'm teen from Poland with passion of IT and Programming.
On my profile you can find respositories with my static site code and my basics publics scripts!

Currently I'm interested in Webdev, definitely in Back-end.
I'm using VSCode and my primary language is PHP at this moment.

My lobby page (for projects): https://fedoszczak.ovh/
My static page: https://jakublog.github.io/site/

<!---
JakubLog/JakubLog is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.

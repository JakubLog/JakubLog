Hello there!
Welcome to my profile.
I'm teen from Poland with passion of IT and Programming.
On my profile you can find respositories with my static site code and my basics publics scripts!

Currently I'm interested in Webdev, definitely in JavaScript and TypeScript.
I'm using VSCode and my primary framework is React.js or Gastby.js.

My personal page: https://fedoszczak.ovh/
